# weather-dashboard

This application is intended to use an API to draw weather forecasts for a given city. The site should show the 5-day forecast for the city and also display the 5 most recent unique, successful searches as buttons to allow for a quick click to re-search that city. This would be done using local storage.
However, currently the site is not fully operational and therefore is lacking some functionality and imagery.

The site can be found at: https://steve4098.github.io/weather-dashboard/
